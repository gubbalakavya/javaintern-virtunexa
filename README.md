To build a Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations with the outlined structure and goals, I will guide you through the process step by step. The solution will include core logic, user interface (GUI), error handling, and database integration for storing user inputs, as well as a reporting mechanism (optional). Let’s break it down into tasks:
1. Design the User Interface (UI):
   For the User Interface, we’ll go with a GUI using Swing since it’s simple, and provides a nice graphical interface.
2. Core Logic Implementation:
         We’ll implement the core logic of basic arithmetic operations in separate classes to make it modular.
3. Data Management (Using SQLite)(not used optional):
            For data management, we will use SQLite to store user input and the results of calculations.
4. Error Handling and Validation:
           We’ll implement validation to handle invalid inputs and divide-by-zero errors.
5. Reports/Feedback (Optional):
         This feature can generate a summary of calculations, store user inputs, and display reports. We can use Apache POI for report generation in Excel format.
Technologies:
•	Java (Core): For developing the application.
•	Swing: For the graphical user interface.
•	SQLite: For storing calculation results.
•	JDBC: For database interaction.




WalkThrough for the FlashCard application :

there are three class files for the application FlashCardApp,FlashCard,FlashCardPlayer to create,save and review the flashcards for the study processes 
1. execute the FlashCard java file
2. to create the own flash cards run FlashCardApp java file enter the questions and answers and save the file in desire location on the computer
3. to review the flash card run FlashCardPlayer java file then load the create flash card file you can use buttons appropriatly and review the quiz
4. end of the process
